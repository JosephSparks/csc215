TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
Terminal: Device through which we communicate with the computer
Alternative names include console, screen, CRT, TTY, VDT, CON
Can also be referred to as a monitor and keyboard
Essentially, the input system

Two kinds of people: programmers and users
Programs should ALWAYS be usable by non-programmers
Not everyone has the same background information, so effective programs should lessen the gap, not increase it

Hardware components typically included in microcomputers that can run CP/M:
Terminal
Memory
CPU
Floppy Disk System
Line Printer

Terminal and the memory and CPU interact with one another directly. The CPU can write to the floppy disk system (storage) and read from storage, whereas the memory or RAM can move data to the line printer to be outputted

The earliest computer terminals used switches, buttons and lights, whereas TTYs and modern terminals (modern at the time of this manual's creation) employ keyboards and monitors

With the creation and widespread popularity of the IC (integrated circuit), keyboards replaced the paper punch tape and reader sections of the TTY

Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) type TVs were the first monitors

8085 processor succeeded the 8080. THe 8080's manual became an industry standard, and although a cheap option, the 8080's technical limitations drove new innovation in microprocessors.

8085 simplified hardware tremendously

CPU needs instructions, this is found in memory (RAM)
RAM is volatile memory, meaning it doesn't save
our programs will be saved in PROM, Programmable Read-Only Memory, and EPROM, Erasable PROM
EPROM is good to write our program, test it, and make changes accordingly
PROM is good once our program is done and we're ready to roll

Original CP/M computers would have anywhere from 70K to a million bytes of memory
We're using VMs so no memory issues for us

HDD or hard disk drives. Each disk has sectors and tracks, and each part of the disk stores memory that can be written over.

Original CP/M computers used line printers, much more advanced means of output than the TTYs that preceeded them.


Fun Facts:
Minimum RAM for CP/M is 16K
Other input devices can be used to overwrite HDDs when our typical input devices are not compatible with certain sources.
Modem is a contraction of modulator-demodulator
